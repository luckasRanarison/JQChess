# Description
This is not an efficient chess implementation (I don't even play chess), I decided to manipulate ojects directly to perform some specific queries because my goal with this project was to explore jQuery.
<p>The game includes all advanced chess moves: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Castling</li>
  <li>Pawn promotion</li>
  <li>En passant</li>
</ul>
It's still missing a lot of features like timer, unsufficient material check...

# Preview
It's not responsive yet so it may not correctly render on mobile devices. <br/>

**NOTE:** Some browsers may not support backdrop filter.
